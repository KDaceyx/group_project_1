Project title: Avocado Price Fluctuation

Team members: Brian, Kerry, Mark

Scope/Description: We will research the relationship between avocado price and other factors such as weather, and region sold.

Research questions to be answered:  Can we find additional growing regions within the United States which have similar climate/weather patterns to already established regions? Could this potentially impact the average price of avocados by stabalizing the supply chain?

•	Mark- research and visualize avocado prices over time nationwide (US)
