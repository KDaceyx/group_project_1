Project title: Avocado Price Fluctuation

Team members: Brian, Kerry, Mark

Scope/Description: We will research the relationship between avocado price and other factors such as weather, holiday/time of year, sporting events, and region sold.

Research questions to be answered:  Where are avocados grown? What is the climate/weather pattern in those areas? What are the demographics of people who buy avocados? Is there a pattern between rising prices and sporting events/holidays? What about drought/changing weather patterns and price?
